Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **GridStream Productions**.

## About Us

GridStream Productions (GSP) is a non-profit internet radio station that started in May 2002. We are one of the oldest MMORPG radio stations, originally founded to serve the player community of Anarchy Online, a science fiction MMO produced by Funcom. Over time, we expanded to cover The Secret World, another Funcom MMO.

GSP is notable for broadcasting "live" from inside virtual worlds. Our DJs—numbering about 20 and located around the world—host regular shows and special events, playing a wide array of music genres including rock, alternative, metal, indie, and electronic.

We operate entirely nonprofit, run by players, for players.

## This GitHub Organization

This GitHub organization hosts the source code for various tools and projects that GSP has created and uses in its daily operations.
