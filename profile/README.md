Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **GridStream Productions**.

## About Us

GridStream Productions (GSP) is a non-profit internet radio station founded in May 2002 by Lan "Tarryk" Kozar and a small group of friends inside the MMORPG Anarchy Online, developed by Funcom. We are one of the oldest MMORPG radio stations, pioneering the concept of live broadcasts originating from within a virtual world.

GSP is notable for broadcasting "live" from inside virtual worlds. Our DJs—located around the world—host regular shows and special events, playing a wide array of music genres including rock, alternative, metal, indie, and electronic. Our programming also includes talk shows, interviews, and comedic skits.

In 2012, we expanded to cover The Secret World, another Funcom MMORPG, and organized the first ever Anarchy Online fan convention. Throughout our history, we've worked closely with Funcom and the AO volunteer ARK team to host seasonal and anniversary events.

We operate entirely nonprofit, run by players, for players.
